# Open Innovation AI Frontend Software Engineer Assignment


## Welcome to task description

First of all, I want to say that there was a CORS error in the API. I set up a Nodejs server to fix this error. This is one of the best ways.Also, the api_key for the task didn't work. I went through the registration on the site and changed the key.Therefore, I will upload the `.env` file to github (we don't normally upload it).


The Nodejs version the task was written in is `20.11.1` 
Enter the following command in the terminal
First step:
`npm i`
Second step:
`npm run start`
Third step:
`http://localhost:5173/`
